NEXT STEPS
- the uniqueness factor is maybe still wrong. I'm not sure if it's doing a
global uniquess of all cards across all commanders first. it might be
only comparing the two given commanders for the edges... may consider starting
over here on the uniqueness score. change it to staple remover or something. 
- add "released_at" from "default-cards..." for each commander
- probably remove lands? mana artifacts?
- maybe set click to outline top 10 connections to troubleshoot accuracy

NOTES
fix error
check new raw weighting
try to figure out tribes in seperate workbook first probably, then import logic into main prepare_viz_data





TO RUN PYTHON THIS IN TERMINAL ON ROOT
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

TO RUN THE FILE:
cd backend/scripts
python prepare_viz_data.py


# From the scripts directory:
python -m viz_preparation.prepare_viz_data

1. Normalized Weight
Accounts for color identity restrictions in commander deck building
Normalizes card overlap based on shared colors between commanders
Higher values indicate strong overlap relative to what's possible within color restrictions
Example: Two mono-white commanders sharing 10 cards is more significant than two 5-color commanders sharing 10 cards


2. Uniqueness Weight
Emphasizes shared cards that are rarely used across all decks
Gives higher weight to niche or specialized card choices
Higher values indicate commanders sharing uncommon/specialized card choices
Example: Two decks sharing niche cards like "Urza's Saga" is more significant than sharing staples like "Sol Ring"


Composite Weight
Balanced combination of normalized overlap (60%) and uniqueness (40%)
Attempts to capture both color-identity constraints and card rarity
Higher values indicate strong, meaningful relationships between commanders
Best for general-purpose visualization of commander relationships


Raw Weight
Simple count of shared cards between commanders
Doesn't account for color identity or card uniqueness
Higher values just mean more cards in common
Useful as a baseline metric but doesn't capture nuanced relationships
